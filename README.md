# Numerical analysis

This repo was created to learn numerical analysis, including topics such as: 

1. Numerical linear algebra.
2. Numerical methods.

## Performance

Each algorithm or decomposition will be written in slow, fast and paralell format to show the differences between looping, vectorisation and paralellisation in Python. Where possible, a comparison to an open source library such as scipy or numpy will be compared.
